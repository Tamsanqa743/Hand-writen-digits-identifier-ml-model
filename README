The Classier_{Suffix} files contain Artificial Neural networks of different architectures.
The ANNs can classifiy handwritten digits after being trained.The user can supply a path to the image they need to classify
There are four programs in total

# How to run programs
***************************************************************************************************************************
1. Build virtual environment by typing make in terminal

2.The MNIST dataset needs to be in the "data" folder

3. Running Each program: 

program Classifier_1.py
 - type make run1 to run (and train) the program
 - after ANN training is complete, enter path to image file to be classified
 
program Classifier_2.py
 - type make run2 to run (and train) the program
 - after ANN training is complete, enter path to image file to be classified.
 
program Classifier_3
 - type make run3 to run (and train) the program
 - after ANN training is complete, enter path to image file to be classified

program Classifier_4.py
 * type make run4 to run (and train) the program
 * after ANN training is complete, enter path to image file to be classified
